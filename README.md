####Patch for installing ns2.35 on Mac os 10.9
It took me a lot of time to compile ns2.35 on my rMBP 15' with Mac OS 10.9.2. Therefore, i decided to share my self-made patch to help more people who are going to do it as well.

1. cd ns-allinone-2.35/
2. patch -p1 -i macos10.9.patch 
3. install

Enjoy!
